  <h3>Create your own Photódex</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Photódex is powered by Flickr's API. To create your own Photódex you must first create a Flickr album.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do so, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create an account on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create an album with the word <strong>"Photódex" in the title</strong> (or just "Photodex" without the accent).
      </li>
      <li>Upload your AR snaps to the album with the following conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You must include the <strong>Pokémon number in 3-digit format</strong> in the photo title
            (e.g. "001 Bulbasaur", "025 Pikachu", "133 Eevee").
          </li>
          <li>
            The photos must be made <strong>public</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Visit your new Photódex page by typing your Flickr username into the box at the top of
        this page and clicking "GO!".
      </li>
      <li>
        Once on your page, you can take note of the URL or bookmark it in your browser to find it faster the next time.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Note that changes or additions to Flickr albums may take a few minutes to update in your Photódex.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142094589@N06/sets/72157697425407712" target="_blank">this Flickr album</a>
      is behind <a href="/JTAtomico" target="_blank">this Photódex</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Advanced</h4>
    <h5>Thumbnial Position</h5>
    <p>
      By default, the photo thumbnail square is taken from the centre of the image.
      To change this, you can add some positional data to your photo title.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For portait photos:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>position=top</strong> aligns the thumbnail to the top of the photo.</li>
          <li><strong>position=bottom</strong> aligns the thumbnail to the bottom of the photo.</li>
          <li>Thumbnail defaults to centre if no position is given.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        For landscape photos:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>position=left</strong> aligns the thumbnail to the left of the photo.</li>
          <li><strong>position=right</strong> aligns the thumbnail to the right of the photo.</li>
          <li>Thumbnail defaults to centre if no position is given.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you can use unicode arrows (↑, ↓, ←, →) as a shothand for these alignments without needing the <strong>position=</strong> instruction.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, "025 Pikachu (position=left)" or just "025 Pikachu ←" would work as a title if your Pikachu is standing on the left side of a landscape photo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Positional instructions must be lower case and must not have spaces around the equals sign.
    </p>
    <h5>Multiple forms</h5>
    <p>
      You can upload multiple forms of the same Pokémon to your album (e.g. to include Shiny Pokémon or Alolan forms).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gallery view, Pokémon with multiple entries have a visual "stacked" indicator and can be cycled through by tapping or clicking,
      or by using the up / down arrow keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order that they appear in the cycle is determined by the order that the different forms appear in the underlying Flickr album,
      which can be changed in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/">Organizr</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first form of a particular Pokémon found in the underlying Flickr album is the one that is used as the thumbnail on the main Photódex view.
    </p>
    <h5>Trainer name</h5>
    <p>
      If you would like the trainer name displayed on your Photódex to be different from your Flickr username,
      you can add a <strong>trainer=</strong> instruction to the album description.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if your album description includes <strong>trainer=TrainerNIA</strong> then your trainer name will show as "TrainerNIA"
      rather than your Flickr username.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trainer name provided must be one word and contain only letters and numbers, which is consistent with valid Pokémon GO trainer names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the URL of your Photódex will still use your Flickr username, as this is required to identify the correct album.
    </p>
    <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
    <p>
      If you are having issues getting your Photódex to appear after following the steps above, please ensure that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Flickr album contains the word "Photódex" or "Photodex" in the title.</li>
      <li>All photos are public.</li>
      <li>Photos have the 3-digit Pokémon number in their titles.</li>
      <li>You have waited a few minutes since making changes in Flickr.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that you may experience unexpected behaviour if you have multiple Flickr albums with "Photódex" in the title.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are still having issues, or have other problems to report, then please
